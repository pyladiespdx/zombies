#"Zombie", the Cranberries lyrics
--------------------------------------------

##1.
# head hangs lowly

#Brains are slowly eaten

#And if violence causes the silence

#What are we becoming

But you see it's not me

It's not my zombie disease

For your head for your head

They are fighting


##2.

With their teeth and their jaws

And their jaws and their claws

Mmmmm your head your head they are eating




###[Chorus]

Your head

Your head

Zombie zombie zombie eating eating

What's in your head

In your head.

Zombie, zombie, zombie eating, eating, ow, ow, ow, ow




##3.

Another mother's breaking heart is taking over the violence causes silence

We must be tasty

It's the same old thing since 1816

For your head for your head

They're still fighting

With their teeth and their jaws

And their jaws and their claws

For your head for your head they are dying




###[Chorus repeats]
